# Project 4 - face generation


## Project Overview

In this project, you'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.
I have used a Deep Convolutional GAN. This DCGAN is made of a pair of multi-layer neural networks that
compete against each other until one learns to generate realistic images of faces.
