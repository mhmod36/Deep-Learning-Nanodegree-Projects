# Project 2: Convolutional Neural Networks


## Project Overview

> Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, I built a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images.
Given an image of a dog, I will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human,
the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

> Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, We will make important design decisions about the user experience as an app.
Our goal is that by completing this lab, you understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks
in a data processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems
without a perfect answer. Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!
