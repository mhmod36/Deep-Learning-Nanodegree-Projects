# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Udacity

## Introduction 
Get your first taste of deep learning by applying style transfer to your own images, and gain experience using development tools such as Anaconda and Jupyter notebooks.

## Neural Networks
Learn neural networks basics, and build your first network with Python and NumPy. Use the modern deep learning framework PyTorch to build multi-layer neural networks, and analyze real data.

## Convolutional Neural Networks
Learn how to build convolutional networks and use them to classify images (faces, melanomas, etc.) based on patterns and objects that appear in them. Use these networks to learn data compression and image denoising.

## Recurrent Neural Networks
Build your own recurrent networks and long short-term memory networks with PyTorch; perform sentiment analysis and use recurrent networks to generate new text from TV scripts.

## Generative Adversarial Networks
Learn to understand and implement a Deep Convolutional GAN (generative adversarial network) to generate realistic images, with Ian Goodfellow, the inventor of GANs, and Jun-Yan Zhu, the creator of CycleGANs.

## Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
Train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model. Deployment gives you the ability to use a trained model to analyze new, user input. Build a model, deploy it, and create a gateway for accessing it from a website.
