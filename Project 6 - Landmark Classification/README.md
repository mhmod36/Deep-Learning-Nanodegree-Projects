## Project 6 - Landmark Classification


# Project Overview

In this project, I built a landmark classifier. Photo-sharing services or photo-storage services may use landmark classification to
automatically tag photos with relevant hashtags or location markers. This type of functionality could be especially important
when photo location metadata is not available, which could happen when a photo is taken without metadata (e.g., phone was
on airplane mode, camera was old and without GPS) or if a photo has had its metadata scrubbed.

In the project, I have applied a machine learning design process end-to-end: performing data preprocessing and augmentation, designing a CNN from
scratch, and training and saving the best CNN model. I have also used transfer learning and compare your transfer-learned model
with your from-scratch CNN.
