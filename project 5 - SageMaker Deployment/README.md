# project 5 - SageMaker Deployment


## Project Overview

In this project, I trained and deployed a PyTorch sentiment analysis model using Amazon SageMaker on AWS. This
model will be trained to do sentiment analysis on movie reviews (positive or negative reviews). I built the model, deployed it, and
created a gateway for accessing this model from a website.
