# Project 1 - Bike Sharing Prediction

## Project Overview

> In this project, I built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up,
using gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch.
and I have applied this network to solve real prediction problems!
